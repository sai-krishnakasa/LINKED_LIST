Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of given key in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
Link List = 1->2->1->2->1->3->1
search_for = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:1 appears 4 times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Link List = 1->2->1->2->1
search_for = 3
Output: 0
Explanation:3 appears 0 times.
Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function count() which takes the head of the link list and search_for i.e- the key as input parameters and returns the count of occurrences of the given key.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

                SOLUTION:
        
     class Solution:
    def count(self, head, search_for):
        k=0
        n=head
        while(n):
            if (n.data==search_for):
                k+=1
            n=n.next
        return k
