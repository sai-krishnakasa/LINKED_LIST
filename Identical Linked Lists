Given two Singly Linked List of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to check whether two linked lists are identical or not. 
Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and with same arrangement too.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5->6
LinkedList2: 99->59->42->20
Output: Not identical 
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5
LinkedList2: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: Identical
 
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function areIdentical() which takes the head of both linked lists as arguments and returns True or False.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

SOLUTION:

def areIdentical(head1, head2):
    n=head1
    n2=head2
    while(n and n2):
        if(n.data !=n2.data):
            return False
        n=n.next
        n2=n2.next
    return True
